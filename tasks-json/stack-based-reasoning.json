    "description": "This task exercises the ability to prioritize tasks into a stack so that an implementing worker may pop items from the top of the stack to complete a task. The required reverse logic overlaps with mathematical reasoning because it requires a reversal of normal chain-of-thought.    Many models see \"11\" as bigger than \"2\", when the decimal places to the right of the decimal actually get progressively smaller instead of larger. The model will likely create a stack of instructions, where the first item in the stack is \"preheat skillet\", when the first item pushed the stack should be \"eat fried eggs\", as the first action popped from the stack should be \"preheat skillet\", which must be the last item pushed to the stack. This requires the model to plan the list, then reverse the items. It does help if you request the model to show the stack as it goes.",
