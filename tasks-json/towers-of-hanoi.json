Given a number of disks and three pegs, move all disks from the first peg to the last peg following these rules: 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg. 3) No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.",
